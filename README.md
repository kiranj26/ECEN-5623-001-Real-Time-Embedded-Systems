- Introduction to Embedded Systems
- Real-Time Operating Systems (RTOS)
- Task Scheduling and Management
- Interrupt Handling
- Real-Time Communication
- Hardware/Software Co-Design

## Assignments
This section includes all the assignments for the course. Each assignment folder contains the problem statement, relevant resources, and submission guidelines. The assignments are designed to reinforce the concepts taught in lectures and provide hands-on experience with real-time embedded systems.

### Homework Assignments
- **Homework 1**: Introduction to real-time systems and task management.
- **Homework 2**: Implementing scheduling algorithms.
- **Homework 3**: Real-time communication protocols.
- **Homework 4**: Interrupt handling in embedded systems.
- **Homework 5**: Final project proposal.

## Projects
The projects section showcases the major projects undertaken during the course. Each project folder includes a detailed description, objectives, required materials, and step-by-step instructions for implementation. Projects are aimed at providing practical experience with real-time systems and their applications.

### Final Project
- **Real-Time Stop Sign Detection**: A project that involves creating a real-time stop sign detection system using image processing and embedded systems techniques. This project includes:
  - System design and architecture.
  - Hardware and software setup.
  - Implementation details.
  - Testing and validation.

## Resources
